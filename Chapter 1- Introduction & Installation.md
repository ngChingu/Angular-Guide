# Introduction

Angular formly known as Angular 2/4 is the predecessor of the very famous Angularjs. After watching out on several issues in the 1st version of angular the google team decided to rewrite the framework. And the result was a totally refined framework wih rich set of features. Angular can be used for both desktop as well as mobile.

In this Guide we will be using Angular CLI extensively as the CLI makes testing very easy and is also easy to setup. Most important thing is that it is beginner friendly.We will guide you through the entire process. feel free to contribute if you have something amazing for others to learn in this guide.
